### Goal: Write your own “documentation” for the higher order functions
**Your documentation should include:**
- A description of the purpose
- A description of the syntax
- An example
- An explanation of the example
- Any additional notes/details

Your documentation here: 

***Higher Order Function***: is a function takes in another function as a argument or returns the function as output

- The purpose to use higher order funtions for example:
```js
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']; // initalized array1 to the value ['a', 'b', 'c']

array1.forEach(element => console.log(element)); // for each element in array1 console.log the element

// expected output: "a"
// expected output: "b"
// expected output: "c"
```
The code shows how we initalizeing `array1` to be an object data type that holds `['a','b','c']` as its value. Next we a used forEach method where
